# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
# Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project utilizes the skills learned in "Introduction to Python" and "Intermediate Python" courses to tackle a real-world data science problem. The objective is to analyze Netflix's movies and TV shows, focusing on two specific aspects.

Firstly, the project investigates whether there is a trend of decreasing movie duration over time. By examining a dataset containing information about Netflix's content, we employ data manipulation techniques using pandas and generate visualizations using matplotlib. This allows us to explore any patterns or changes in movie duration over time.

Secondly, the project delves into the popular TV show "The Office" to identify the guest stars who appear in the most popular episode. Through data analysis and manipulation, we aim to extract meaningful insights regarding the guest stars' appearances in the show. This analysis requires utilizing Python's programming concepts and working with datasets related to episodes and guest stars.

The project provides an opportunity to apply the learned skills in a practical setting. By analyzing and visualizing data from Netflix's content and "The Office," we can gain valuable insights into trends and patterns. This project showcases the power of Python for data science and demonstrates the use of various libraries and techniques to solve real-world problems.
